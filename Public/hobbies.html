    <h1>My Hobbies/Interests</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <img src="../images/robot.jpg" alt="Pictue of me with a robot at a convention" height="500">
    <p>As I said on the previous page technology has always been a passion of mine which I think is obvious when you see how happy I was <br> to take a picture with this robot I found at a security convention at the <abbr title="National Exhibition Centre"><a href="https://thenec.co.uk/">NEC</a></abbr> in Birmingham.  </p>

    <h2>The Outdoors and Nature</h2>
    <img src="../images/snow.jpg" alt="Picture of a park covered in snow" height="500">
    <p>I enjoy going on walks as it allows me to take time to step back from stuff and just be able to think clearly. This is a picture I took at my local park <br> when it snowed (Wish it would snow more) I would say that snow is my favorite type of weather as its so beautiful and the glow it gives off just makes me feel happy. </p>

    <h2>Anime/Manga</h2>
    <img src="../images/great-anime-shows.jpg" alt="Collage of a bunch of anime characters" height="500"/>
    <p>Anime has always been a big part of my life even at the ages of like 7 I remember watching Dragon Ball Z which is a very good first anime if you ask me. At this point now I must have watched 1000's of hours of anime and I have compiled a list of my favorites</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Bleach (Fantastic soundtrack and even better fights. The thousand year bloodwar arc is peak anime)</li>
        <li>Naruto (Naruto is just a classic anime that I would recommend to anybody who has not watched it yet)</li>
        <li>Sword Art Online (It feels weird to put this at number 3 on my list since I did not enjoy every season but the first two seasons make up for it)</li>
        
    </ol>
